# Let's Eat

## Description

This is an app that returns an instant restaurant suggestion result based on the user’s location, whether by zipcode, neighborhood, or address. Its goal is to streamline the restaurant decision-making process by generating only one restaurant at random. This app was created in response to the overwhelming choices people face each day, in fulfillment of Columbia University’s Coding Engineering Bootcamp, Project 1.
